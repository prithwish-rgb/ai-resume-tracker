  - Implemented loading states for form submissions
  - Added timeout handling for API requests

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` - Application-wide error boundary
- `src/components/ui/loading-spinner.tsx` - Reusable loading components
- `src/lib/api-utils.ts` - Enhanced API utilities with timeout and error handling
- `src/hooks/useJobs.ts` - Custom hook for job state management

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added ErrorBoundary wrapper
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Improved loading states
- `src/app/jobs/page.tsx` - Enhanced error handling and loading indicators

### 3. Performance Optimizations ✅
- **Problem**: Potential memory leaks and inefficient state management
- **Solution**:
  - Created custom hooks with proper cleanup
  - Added performance monitoring utilities
  - Implemented debounced functions for better performance
  - Added local storage helpers with error handling
  - Enhanced API call handling with proper timeout management

**Files Created:**
- `src/lib/api-utils.ts` - Utility functions for API calls and performance
- `src/hooks/useJobs.ts` - Optimized state management hook

### 4. Configuration Improvements ✅
- **Problem**: OneDrive permission issues and workspace warnings
- **Solution**:
  - Updated Next.js configuration to handle OneDrive folder permissions
  - Fixed workspace root warnings
  - Added proper TypeScript and ESLint configuration
  - Optimized build settings

**Files Modified:**
- `next.config.ts` - Enhanced configuration for better compatibility

2. **Error Retry** - Automatic retry mechanisms for failed operations
3. **Memory Leak Prevention** - Proper cleanup in hooks and components
4. **Debounced Functions** - Optimized user interactions

### UI/UX Improvements
1. **Responsive Design** - Better mobile and tablet experience
2. **URL Handling** - Smart truncation and clickable links
3. **Loading States** - Clear feedback during operations
4. **Error Messages** - User-friendly error displays with actions

## Testing Notes

The application now includes:
- ✅ Comprehensive error boundaries
- ✅ Improved loading states
- ✅ Better URL handling in forms and cards
- ✅ Responsive design improvements
- ✅ Performance optimizations
- ✅ Configuration fixes for development environment

## Usage Examples

### Using the new loading components:
```tsx
import { PageLoading, ButtonLoading } from '@/components/ui/loading-spinner';

// Full page loading
if (loading) return <PageLoading text="Loading jobs..." />;

// Button loading state
<Button disabled={isSubmitting}>
  {isSubmitting && <ButtonLoading />}
  {isSubmitting ? 'Adding...' : 'Add Job'}
</Button>
```

### Using the jobs hook:
```tsx
import { useJobs } from '@/hooks/useJobs';

const { jobs, loading, error, addJob, clearError } = useJobs();
```

### Using API utilities:
```tsx
import { apiCall, truncateUrl } from '@/lib/api-utils';

const response = await apiCall('/api/jobs', { timeout: 5000 });
const shortUrl = truncateUrl(longUrl, 50);
```

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- Responsive design works on all screen sizes

## Next Steps for Further Improvement
1. Add unit tests for new components and hooks
2. Implement service worker for offline functionality
3. Add real-time notifications for job status updates
4. Implement data caching for better performance
5. Add accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

The application should now feel much more stable and provide a smoother user experience with better error handling and loading states.
